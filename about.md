I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistical Science. I joined the department after finishing a NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Statistics Department at Harvard University. Prior to that I completed my PhD in statistics at the University of Washington in Seattle and a joint Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Master's degree in Statistics from the University of Chicago. My research concentrates on developing theory and methodological tools for computational social science applications, with particular interests in high dimensional data and network analysis. I am interested in assessing fundamental assumptions such as exchangeability and stochastic equivalence that underly many network models and to this end has developed testing and estimation procedures for complex dependence structures among actors in a network. I have also been working on tools for causal inference and missing data problems in complex observational studies. I have two distinct but complimentary threads in this direction: (1) nearly exact matching in high dimensional covariate spaces and (2) settings where networks lead to a breakdown of traditional approaches. I am currently the Associate Director of the newly formed Polarization Lab at Duke.
