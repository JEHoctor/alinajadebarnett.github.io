<p>I am an assistant professor of statistical science at Duke University. 
	I frequently find myself studying fundamental properties of different statistical concepts 
	and am broadly interested in network analysis, causal inference and computational constraints of statistical methods.</p>
	
	<p>Come to our workshop at NIPS 2017 in Long Beach, CA: 
		<a hrefh="https://sites.google.com/view/causalnips2017">
			From 'What If?' To 'What Next?' : Causal Inference and Machine Learning for Intelligent Decision Making</a>.
		The deadline for extended abstract submission is October 30, 2017.

	<p> I help run the <a href="http://groups.imstat.org/newresearchers/">New Researchers Group</a> at the 
		<a href="http://www.imstat.org/">Institute of Mathematical Statistics</a> which coordinates the 
	Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability. </p>
