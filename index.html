    <p>I am a Ph.D. student advised by Cynthia Rudin at the Duke University Department of Computer Science, graduating May 2023. I research interpretable deep learning for computer vision with applications in clinical medicine. My work has been featured in NeurIPS spotlight (top 3\% of accepted papers), CVPR (IEEE/CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference), Nature Machine Intelligence, and SPIE Medical Imaging. I was PI for a $19,831 grant from the Duke Incubation Fund for interdisciplinary work on interpretable mammogram analysis. I have many academic awards, a long history of service positions and two competitive Canadian national research awards. I am also a classical musician, active community volunteer and former varsity coxswain.</p>
