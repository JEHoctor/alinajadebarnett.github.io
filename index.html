<p>I am the Millard E. Gladfelter Professor of <a href="https://www.fox.temple.edu/departments/statistical-science/" target="_blank">Statistics</a> and Data Science, and a Professor of <a href="https://www.fox.temple.edu/departments/finance/" target="_blank">Finance</a> (by courtesy), in the Fox School of Business, at Temple University. I also serve as Co-Director of the <a href="https://www.fox.temple.edu/institutes-centers/data-science-institute/" target="_blank">Temple Data Science Institute</a>.</p>

<p>My research focuses on statistical methodology and theory for designing and analyzing experiments on large networks and, more generally, on modeling and inferential issues that arise in analyses that leverage network data. I have developed methodology to work with unstructred text data. I enjoy applying these methods to problems in the social sciences and healthcare, in Tech, and in Finance.</p>

<p>My current research interests include:
    <ol>
        <li> Design and analysis of experiments in complex settings
        <li> Methodology for the analysis of network data
        <li> Geometry of inference in ill-posed inverse problems, including network tomography and contingency tables
        <li> Approximate inference strategies for data analysis at scale
        <li> Applied research in finance with focus on systematic trading, text analysis, and molecular biology
    </ol>
<p>
  Areas of technical interest include approximation theorems, inequalities, convex and combinatorial optimization, and geometry.</p>
		
<p>If you are interested in contributing to Data Science efforts at Fox, please reach out via email with your CV. Current projects include design of experiments, causal analyses, and identification strategiesd in Tech, methodology for systematic trading in Finance, and golf analytics.</p>
	
<p>During normal times, you could find me at JSM, AISTATS, NIPS, ICLM, and at Atlantic Causal Inference conference.</p>
