<p>I am an assistant professor of statistical science at Duke University. 
	I frequently find myself studying fundamental properties of different statistical concepts 
	and am broadly interested in network analysis, causal inference and computational constraints of statistical methods.
	I am the Co-Director of the <a href="https://www.polarizationlab.com/">Polarization Lab at Duke</a>. 
	Check our our newest work on <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/11/20/1906420116">assessing the effects 
	of Russian trolls on political attitudes and behaviors in 2017</a>.</p>

	<p>I am one of the organizers of the <a href="https://www.samsi.info/programs-and-activities/2020-spring-semester-program-on-causal-inference/">SAMSI Semester Program on Causal Inference</a> in Spring 2020. 
		The opening workshop was held in December 2019. 
		Closing workshops will be held at some point (possibly at next year's ACIC!).</p>	
	
	<p> I help run the <a href="http://groups.imstat.org/newresearchers/">New Researchers Group</a> at the 
		<a href="http://www.imstat.org/">Institute of Mathematical Statistics</a> which coordinates the 
	Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability (supported by the 
		National Science Foundation). Our 2020 meeting is currently on hold but check out the website for updates!</p>
	
	<p> If interested in joining our group to work on exciting problems in statistical methodology for
		political polarization, network analysis and large scale causal inference, please reach out via email 
		with your CV. </p>
	
	<p> Travel is mainly postponed. Depending on how conferences go online you will find me or members of the lab at 
		AISTATS, UAI, JSM, CMSTATS and others.</p>
	
	<p> Our work is graciously supported by NIH, NSF, ARI, Facebook, and Duke University. </p>
