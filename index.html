<p>I am an assistant professor of statistical science at Duke University. 
	I frequently find myself studying fundamental properties of different statistical concepts 
	and am broadly interested in network analysis, causal inference and computational constraints of statistical methods.</p>

	<p> Come out to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/causal-netsci2018/home">Network Causal Inference and Design of Experiments Workshop</a> 
		in Paris this June. One day of the workshop will run as a NetSci satellite and another day as a standalone meeting at the University of Chicago Center in Paris.
		Submission deadline is rolling!</p>
	
	<p> Come out to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/causaluai2018">7th Causal Inference Workshop at UAI</a> in August, 2018 in Monterey, CA. 
		Submission deadline for contributed talks and posters is May 20, 2018</p>
	
	<p>We had a great workshop at NIPS 2017 in Long Beach, CA: 
		<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/causalnips2017">
			From 'What If?' To 'What Next?' : Causal Inference and Machine Learning for Intelligent Decision Making</a>.
		The website includes details, abstracts and slides.

	<p> I help run the <a href="http://groups.imstat.org/newresearchers/">New Researchers Group</a> at the 
		<a href="http://www.imstat.org/">Institute of Mathematical Statistics</a> which coordinates the 
	Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability. Come to our meeting hosted by Simon Fraser University! </p>
	
	<p> I will also be attending the following meetings with various talks and symposia: ACIC 2018, ISBA 2018, NetSci 2018, SLDS 2018, JSM 2018, UAI 2018... </p>
