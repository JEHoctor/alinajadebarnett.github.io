<p>I am an assistant professor of statistical science at Duke University. 
	I frequently find myself studying fundamental properties of different statistical concepts 
	and am broadly interested in network analysis, causal inference and computational constraints of statistical methods.
	I am the Co-Director of the <a href="https://www.polarizationlab.com/">Polarization Lab at Duke</a>.
