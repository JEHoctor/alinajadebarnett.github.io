<p>I am an assistant professor of statistical science at Duke University. 
	I frequently find myself studying fundamental properties of different statistical concepts 
	and am broadly interested in network analysis, causal inference and computational constraints of statistical methods.
	I am the Associate Director of the new Polarization Lab at Duke.</p>

	<p> We had a great workshop on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/causal-netsci2018/home">Network Causal Inference and Design of Experiments Workshop</a> 
		in Paris this June. One day of the workshop will run as a NetSci satellite and another day as a standalone meeting at the University of Chicago Center in Paris.
		The website includes abstracts and details.</p>
	
	<p> The <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/causaluai2018">7th Causal Inference Workshop at UAI</a> in August, 2018 in Monterey, CA was very well attended! 
		Abstracts and contributed papers are on the website.</p>
	
	
	<p> I help run the <a href="http://groups.imstat.org/newresearchers/">New Researchers Group</a> at the 
		<a href="http://www.imstat.org/">Institute of Mathematical Statistics</a> which coordinates the 
	Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability. Contact me if you would like to get involved and 
	join us next year in Colorado.</p>
	
	<p> I will also be attending the following meetings with various talks and symposia: NIPS 2018, CMstats 2018, NetSci-X 2019,... </p>
