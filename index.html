    <p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in mathematics and computer science enrolled in Temple University's Honors program. I am a research assistant at Temple University's Data Science Institute working with <a href="https://airoldi.github.io/">Dr. Edoardo Airoldi</a>, <a href="http://www.mcalinn.com/">Dr. Ken McAlinn</a>, and Dr. Jeanne Ruane and the <a href="https://dabi.temple.edu/">Center for Data Analytics and Biomedical Informatics</a> working with <a href = "https://dabi.temple.edu/zoran-obradovic/">Dr. Zoran Obradovic</a>. My research currently explores modeling the formation of networks with non-scale-free degree distributions. Outside of my network science interests, I am also passionate about causal inference and machine learning. In a recent project, I partnered with the Philly start-up <a href="https://gopuff.com/go">Gopuff</a> to explore the effects of COVID-19 on tipping behavior.</p>
    
    <p>In the past, I was a teaching assistant for an undergraduate/graduate cross listed class, Applied Statistics and Data Science. Resources for this course are available in the <a href="./teaching">Teaching section</a>. I was also a teaching assistant from Elements of Data Science and Introduction to Python and a tutor in the math department. </p>

    <p>Over the summer, I was a data science intern with Disney+ and ESPN+. Before that, I was also an intern for the Bureau of Labor Statistics studying the immigrant wage gap, a research intern at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia investigating regional economic outlook, and a data science intern at Dyson, Inc. I was also a research assistant for Dr. David Smith at Temple University's <a href="https://sites.temple.edu/neuroeconlab/">Neuroeconomics Lab</a>.</p>
