<p>I am an assistant professor of statistical science at Duke University. 
	I frequently find myself studying fundamental properties of different statistical concepts 
	and am broadly interested in network analysis, causal inference and computational constraints of statistical methods.</p>
	
	<p> I help run the <a href="http://groups.imstat.org/newresearchers/conferences/nrc.html">New Researchers Group</a> at the 
		<a href="http://www.imstat.org/">Institute of Mathematical Statistics</a> which coordinates the 
	Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability. </p>
