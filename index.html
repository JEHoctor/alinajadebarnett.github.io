  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I am a third-year undergraduate majoring in economics, mathematics and computer science enrolled in Temple University's Honors program. I am a research assistant at Temple University's Data Science Institute working with <a href="airoldi.github.io">Dr. Edoardo Airoldi</a>, <a href="mcalinn.com">Dr. Ken McAlinn</a>, and Dr. Jeanne Ruane. My research currently explores causal inference and statistical machine learning. In my most recent project, I partnered with the Philly start-up <a href="https://gopuff.com/go">goPuff</a> </p> to explore the effects of COVID-19 on tipping behavior.
    <p>I was a teaching assistant from Elements of Data Science and Introduction to Python and a tutor in the math department. I was also an intern for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a research intern at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and a data science intern at Dyson, Inc.</p>
