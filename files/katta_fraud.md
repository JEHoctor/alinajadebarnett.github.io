title: Identifying Modifiable Factors to Moderate
  Risk Factors for Susceptibility to Financial Scams in Older Adults

Aim
===

Financial scams are becoming more ubiquitous and sophisticated,
especially with the aid of new technology. For example, Temple
University faculty and students received this email recently that
attempted to scam recipients into revealing credit card and social
security numbers.

![Financial scam email at Temple University on April 24,
2021.](files/temple_scam.png) Older adults are frequently the targets of
financial exploitation. With the growing population of older adults,
understanding how to combat this problem is crucial. Prior work suggests
that victims of financial exploitation are often from low socioeconomic
status groups (Choi & Mayer, 2000), have poorer cognitive functioning
(James et al., 2014), have more severe depression (Butters et al., 2008;
Dotson et al., 2010), and are more socially withdrawn (Choi & Mayer,
2000). However, very little is known about how different variables
moderate the effects of these known risk factors. My main goal is to
understand what/how modifiable factors can moderate the effects of
unmodifiable risk factors. I explore a few of these relationships to
identify the best policy recommendations by analyzing data from two
waves of a survey that I conducted in collaboration with faculty in
Temple University and Adelphi University’s faculty.

Questions and Problem
=====================

While there are many risk factors associated with fraud susceptibility,
I focus on a few here. First, I investigate whether trust is correlated
with fraud risk since there is conflicting evidence in the literature
(Choi & Mayer, 2000; James et al., 2014). I then ask whether physical
health can moderate this relationship between trusting behavior and risk
of fraud. I also investigate whether physical health and median
household income, a proxy for socioeconomic status, can help moderate
the relationship between social support and risk of fraud.

Scope
=====

Survey data on financial susceptibility was collected in two waves. The
first wave collected data on respondents from the Philadelphia
metropolitan area, while the second wave collected data on respondents
from urban, suburban, and rural areas across Pennsylvania; the goal of
the second wave was to target areas with the highest and lowest
socioeconomic statuses and the highest and lowest population densities.
County-level median household income data came from the website, Income
By Zip Code (*Pennsylvania Income Statistics—Current Census Data for Zip
Codes*, n.d.). The results aim to find strategies to combat financial
fraud in the *Pennsylvania region*.

Methods
=======

Participants
------------

Survey data was collected using Qualtrics’ panel data collection
services. For the first wave, I recruited 625 participants aged 50 and
older who resided within a 20-mile radius of the Philadelphia,
metropolitan area. Our sample size was determined based on power
calculations to detect group differences according to our primary
hypotheses with an effect size of d = 0.40, 80% power and a significance
level of p = 0.05. For the second wave, I recruited an additional 384
participants aged 50 and older, who alternatively resided in both urban
and rural areas that encompass varying levels of household income within
the state of Pennsylvania. Our sample size for study 2 was determined to
achieve 80% power to detect interactions with an effect size of f = 0.25
at an alpha of 0.00555.

When the data collection period ended, I observed a total of 1,000
complete survey responses between our two studies, 625 from the
Philadelphia region (wave 1) and 375 from non-Philadelphia areas
throughout Pennsylvania (wave 2). Participants in wave 1 ranged in age
from 50 to 91 years old (age: M = 62.2, SD = 7.9), with a majority
identifying as female (57%) and White (81%). Participants in wave 2 were
of a similar demographic makeup, with an age range of 50 to 82 years old
(age: M = 61.6, SD = 7.2); 59% female, and 80% White. No participants
were removed from the sample, and all participants electronically
consented to participate in the study before completing the survey.

In our analyses for the second wave of data, our sample size per
analysis changes slightly because I included participants who may not
have completed all of the surveys but did for the measure(s) in
question. For instance, if a participant completed the demographic,
gullibility, and OAFEM questionnaires but not the need to belong
questionnaire, then that participant would be used for all analyses
involving demographics, gullibility, and/or OAFEM but not any that
involve the need to belong scale.

Evidenced by the tables below, data is not equally balanced across
demographics. Across both waves, there are more males than
females/other, more white people than any other race, and more married
people than any other marital status group.

Survey Scales and Questionaires
-------------------------------

While a larger corpus of surveys were utilized, I detail the main
surveys used in the analyses here. The Older Adult Financial
Exploitation Measure (OAFEM; Conrad et al. (2010)) is the main dependent
variable of my analyses. It is a self-reported measure of risk for
financial scams and asks questions like, “Has someone given you poor
reasons for spending your money in the past twelve months?” I also use
the PROMIS physical health scale (Hays et al., 2017). In order to
measure a respondent’s ability to discriminate between trustworthy and
untrustworthy behaviors, I used a new scale from Teunisse et al. (2020)
that asks questions like, “You are usually quick to notice when someone
is trying to cheat you.”

Data Analysis
-------------

In terms of scoring, I followed the directions outlined by each survey’s
authors, except for the Older Adult Financial Exploitation Measure
(OAFEM), a self-reported measure of susceptibility to financial scams
the main dependent variable in the analyses. While it traditionally has
four responses (i.e. yes, no, suspected, unknown), I only considered the
yes and no answers for our scoring. Additionally, I used the optional
categorization of questions based on the severity of the scam situation
to weight certain questions over others. I then took the sum of each
question. Because the data was heavily zero-inflated, OAFEM was
categorized into three groups: “No risk,” which describes respondents
with an OAFEM score of 0; “Low risk,” which describes respondents with
OAFEM scores between 0 and the non-zero-median; and “High risk,” which
describes respondents whose OAFEM scores are greater than the median.

Our scoring guidelines for socioeconomic status also differed between
studies. In wave one, I took the sum of our four questions on
socioeconomic status (i.e., the highest salary ever earned, current
monthly expenses, level of educational attainment, and annual household
income), each of which had eight possible answers to develop a
socioeconomic status index that ranged from 4 to 32, 32 indicating a
high socioeconomic status. After discovering data on median household
income per zip code, I believed this would be a better proxy for
accessibility to resources and therefore socioeconomic status. So, in
wave two, I matched participants to the median household income for
people over the age of 60 for his or her zip code of residence.

Additionally, I dummy coded the following variables: levels of
educational attainment, race/ethnicity, gender, marital status, income,
highest annual salary, and working situation. Due to the corner-solution
in the OAFEM distribution, I split OAFEM into three tiers. I classified
respondents who scored a zero on OAFEM as having “no risk” of fraud,
respondents whose OAFEM scores were less than the median of the non-zero
scores as being at “low risk” of fraud, and those whose OAFEM scores
were greater than or equal to the median of the non-zero scores as being
at “high risk” of fraud.

In terms of statistical analyses, in wave 1, I performed ANOVAs of the
following form:
*D**e**p**e**n**d**e**n**t* ∼ *O**A**F**E**M*<sub>3 − *t**i**e**r*</sub> \* *M**o**d**e**r**a**t**o**r*<sub>2 − *t**i**e**r*</sub>,

where *O**A**F**E**M*<sub>3 − *t**i**e**r*</sub> refers to the
trichotomized OAFEM measure and
*M**o**d**e**r**a**t**o**r*<sub>2 − *t**i**e**r*</sub> is a dichotomized
independent variable split at the median.

<!-- ## Temporal Discounting -->
<!-- Temporal discounting is a topic that details how people compare value in the future to value today. For example, the Temporal Discounting survey asked questions like, "do you prefer \$15 today or \$20 in 2 days?" The people who choose the "\$15 today" option are more impulsive and value instant gratification over long term gratification. Changing such behavior is very difficult and may be closely linked to financial scams as they often claim to offer instant gratification. I first explore whether this hypothesis is true and then investigate the role of different modifiable factors in moderating the relationship between impulsivity and risk of financial fraud. -->

Trust and Financial Exploitation
--------------------------------

The role of trust in financial exploitation is somewhat contested; some
claim that increased trusting behavior is positively correlated with
risk of financial exploitation because they are more willing to believe
the exploiter. On the other hand, some believe that trusting behavior is
actually negatively correlated with risk for financial exploitation
because while people are more prone to trust others, they are able to
distinguish between credible and incredible cues. I first tested the
relationship between Insensitivity to Trustworthiness Cues, a survey
measure that captures someone’s ability to discriminate between
trustworthy and untrustworthy behavior, and susceptibility to financial
scams.

Figure 1A displays the relationship between risk for financial fraud and
trusting behavior across both survey waves, specifically for the low and
high-risk groups (i.e., *O**A**F**E**M* ≠ 0). Figure 1B displays how
physical health can moderate the relationship between risk of financial
exploitation and trusting behavior for wave one survey data. The bars
represent 95% confidence intervals. And Figure 1B displays how physical
health can moderate the relationship between risk of financial
exploitation and trusting behavior for wave two survey data. Figure 1A
demonstrates that across both waves of data collection, as the risk for
fraud increases, so to does trusting behavior, suggesting that trusting
behavior is a risk factor for financial exploitation. However, Figure 1B
suggests that trusting behavior is statistically significantly moderated
by health (*F*(1, 621) = 6.09, *p* = 0.014). Most evident is that the
difference between trusting behavior within each risk group increases,
with people with higher health being able to better identify
trustworthiness; this change across risk groups suggests that improved
health may reduce the relationship between trusting behavior and risk of
fraud. However, the relationship does not exist in Wave 2 data
(*F*(1, 366) = 0.44, *p* = 0.509), evidenced by Figure 1C, potentially
because of differences in demographic factors.

Social Support and Financial Exploitation
-----------------------------------------

Significant research has demonstrated that social support is directly
related to risk of fraud (Choi & Mayer, 2000; James et al., 2014).
Interestingly, Roberto & Teaster (2011) reported that a large component
of financial exploitation cases are perpetrated by friends and family
(34%); those with poor social support are likely to be taken advantage
of and financially abused. However, instituting policy interventions to
alter social support and convincing older adults to take advantage of
them are incredibly difficult. In order to counteract its effects, I
explore how physical health and socioeconomic status moderate the
relationship between risk of financial fraud and social support.

Figure 2A displays how physical health can moderate the relationship
between risk of financial exploitation and social support for wave one
survey data. Figure 2B displays how physical health can moderate the
relationship between risk of financial exploitation and social support
for wave two survey data. The bars represent 95% confidence intervals.
Figure 2A suggests that social support is statistically significantly
moderated by physical health (*F*(1, 621) = 4.258, *p* = 0.039).
Furthermore, Figure 2A demonstrates that the difference between social
support within each risk group decreases as risk group increases, with
people with higher health having greater social support; this change
across risk groups suggests that improved health may improve the reduce
the association between a lack of social support and risk of fraud. The
behavior is also replicated in the wave two data
(*F*(1, 363) = 10.55, *p* = 0.001); however, unlike the wave one data,
social support in the high risk group is significantly greater for the
less healthy than the healthy, recommending that improved health can
benefit people in the low risk group but not the high risk group.

Figure 3A displays how improved local income levels cannot moderate the
relationship between risk of financial exploitation and social support
for wave one survey data. Figure 3B displays how physical health cannot
moderate the relationship between risk of financial exploitation and
social support for wave two survey data. The bars represent 95%
confidence intervals. Figure 3A suggests that social support is not
statistically significantly moderated by socioeconomic status
(*F*(1, 466) = 0.794, *p* = 0.373). The behavior is also replicated in
the wave two data (*F*(1, 362) = 0.25, *p* = 0.617), implying that local
stimulus packages may not change the relationship between social support
and risk of fraud.

Main Conclusions
================

While I found that insensitivity to trustworthiness cues is positively
correlated with risk of fraud specifically for the people at low or high
risk of fraud, health moderates this relationship. Therefore, in order
to minimize the risk of fraud for people unable to discriminate between
trustworthy and untrustworthy behaviors, I recommend instituting a
randomized controlled trial to identify whether policies like free gym
access can minimize people’s risk of fraud. Furthermore, I found that
improved physical health can help minimize the association between low
social support and risk of fraud, which is strong evidence to suggest
instituting healthy-living programs for older adults. While I
investigated whether median household income, a proxy for socioeconomic
status, could moderate the relationship between social support and risk
of fraud, I did not find evidence to suggest that is the case. Future
extensions of this work will investigate the relationship between these
moderators and risk factors in more balanced survey in the third wave of
data collection. While surveys are not conclusive evidence of causal
relationships and sometimes lack ecological validity because of
self-reporting, these results mark an important first step in combating
financial fraud.
